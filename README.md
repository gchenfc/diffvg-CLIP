# diffvg + CLIP

This was originally done as part of a class project for CS 7643 Fall 2021.

It is very similar to [CLIPDraw](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.14843.pdf) which I didn't learn about until I was tuning parameters for this and went to search for inspiration.

It is using [diffvg](https://github.com/BachiLi/diffvg) and [CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP).
